# Cybersecurity Project Labs

A collection of hands-on projects completed during my first year of a **Master's in Cybersecurity**. These labs focus on practical skills in **network security, threat detection, and defensive technologies**, including:

| **Project Area**       | **Key Skills Demonstrated**                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Firewall Configuration** | Rule-based filtering, NAT, stateful inspection |
| **VPN Setup**          | Secure tunneling (IPSec/OpenVPN), authentication |
| **Intrusion Detection (IDS)** | Signature-based/behavioral analysis (Snort/Suricata) |
| **Intrusion Prevention (IPS)** | Real-time threat blocking, log analysis |
| **Network Security**   | Subnetting, ACLs, VLAN segmentation |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Tools: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS |
| **Incident Response**  | Log correlation, threat containment strategies |

**Objective**: Apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios while hardening systems against common attack vectors.
